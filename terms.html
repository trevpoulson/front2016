				<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                
				<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
				<p>By purchasing a ticket to Front, you agree that you have read, and you agree to abide by the terms outlined here. Attendees must be 21 years or older. All sales are final. Tickets may not be sold. Tickets may be transferred to someone else until two weeks before the event. Sponsorship, press, or complimentary passes may not be transferred. Attendees are eligible for the student discount if they are attending full-time and are not working full-time.</p>
                
                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We care about your privacy. Here’s what we collect about you and what we use it for. We collect anonymous information about visitors to our website as part of the ticket purchase process, using nvite. We collect a small amount personal information when you register for a ticket so that we can create badges, order t-shirts, gauge geographical interest, and to communicate with you about the event. Besides anonymous information about companies and geographic representation that we provide sponsors, we will not sell or share your information with anyone.
</p>
				<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                
				<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Be welcoming:</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
</p>
				
                <p><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
</p>
                <p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose:</strong> we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
</p>
					<ul>
                	<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
                    <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
                    <li>Posting on Slack sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
                    <li>Posting on Slack (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
                    <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
                    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
                    <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
